# Js-Password-Generator
This is an application to generate a random passwrod for a user

# Description
A JavaScript application that generates random passwords based on information gained by the user. For example, the user can chose between 4 character sets to have in their random password. These character sets are uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Also the password length must only be between 10 and 64 characters. If the user doesn't pick a number between 10 and 64 or fails to pick at least one of the character sets provided, they will be prompted to try again.
